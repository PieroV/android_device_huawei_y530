# Device directory for HUAWEI Ascend Y530

HUAWEI Ascend Y530 is a smartphone based on Snapdragon MSM8210.
This is the device directory to port Cyanogenmod to it.

Note that this isn't ready, yet, and we have to fix proprietary blobs, since we are using those from G630 (JB based).

This directory wouldn't have been possible without guys from https://github.com/AscendG630-DEV .
